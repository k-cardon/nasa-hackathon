Weather-based planning for your adventures!

## A NASA Space Apps Challenger

PlanMyWeather uses historical weather data from NASA's POWER API to let users make smart travels plan based on a *prediction* of the weather at the destination


## What is it, techincally?

We created a simple web app developed using frameworks and languages such as Svelte, TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

*CURRENT LOCATIONS available in the App are Gothenburg, Malm√∂ and Stockholm. Plans are to enable the search of any location and return local points of interest.*

## Is this 'vibe-coded'?

We used AI (ChatGPT) to create an early mock-up of the web app. No code or assets from the AI was used in the final product.
